# Unit Tests for Admin Panel Authorization System

This document describes the comprehensive unit tests created for the User Controller, Role Controller, and Auth Service components of the Admin Panel authorization system.

## Overview

We have created extensive unit tests covering:
- **UserController** - All authentication and user management endpoints
- **RoleController** - All role management endpoints  
- **AuthService** - Core authentication and authorization business logic
- **DTO Validation** - Data transfer object validation and structure tests

## Test Files Created

### 1. UserControllerTests.cs
**Location**: `AdminPanel.Tests/Controller.Tests/UserControllerTests.cs`

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Login endpoint (`POST /users/login`)
- ✅ Check page access (`POST /users/access`)
- ✅ Token validation (`GET /users/validate`)
- ✅ Get all users (`GET /users`)
- ✅ Get user by ID (`GET /users/{id}`)
- ✅ Add user (`POST /users`)
- ✅ Update user (`PUT /users`)
- ✅ Delete user (`DELETE /users/{id}`)
- ✅ Get user roles (`GET /users/{id}/roles`)
- ✅ Add user to role (`POST /users/{id}/roles`)
- ✅ Remove user from role (`DELETE /users/{id}/roles`)

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- Successful authentication with valid credentials
- Failed authentication with invalid credentials
- Token validation for valid and invalid tokens
- User CRUD operations with success and failure cases
- Role assignment and removal operations
- Error handling and edge cases

### 2. RoleControllerTests.cs
**Location**: `AdminPanel.Tests/Controller.Tests/RoleControllerTests.cs`

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Get all roles (`GET /roles`)
- ✅ Get role by ID (`GET /roles/{id}`)
- ✅ Delete role (`DELETE /roles/{id}`)
- ✅ Get all permissions (`GET /roles/permissions`)
- ✅ Get role permissions (`GET /roles/{id}/permissions`)
- ✅ Add role (`POST /roles`)
- ✅ Update role (`PUT /roles`)

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- Role retrieval with existing and non-existing roles
- Role creation with valid and invalid data
- Role updates with permission management
- Role deletion operations
- Permission listing and role-permission associations
- Exception handling and error propagation

### 3. AuthServiceTests.cs
**Location**: `AdminPanel.Tests/Bll.Tests/AuthServiceTests.cs`

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Login with internal and external authentication
- ✅ JWT token validation
- ✅ User management (CRUD operations)
- ✅ Role management (CRUD operations)
- ✅ User-role associations
- ✅ Permission checking and page access control
- ✅ Token generation and validation

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- Internal authentication flow
- External authentication integration
- User creation with role assignment
- User updates including password changes
- Role-based access control validation
- Permission inheritance and checking
- JWT token lifecycle management

### 4. DtoValidationTests.cs
**Location**: `AdminPanel.Tests/Bll.Tests/DtoValidationTests.cs`

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ CreateUserDto validation (required name field)
- ✅ AccessRequestDto validation (required target page)
- ✅ DTO structure validation for all authentication DTOs
- ✅ Collection initialization and null reference handling
- ✅ Boundary value testing

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- Required field validation
- Data structure integrity
- Collection handling (empty vs null)
- Boundary value testing
- Type safety and nullability

## Testing Patterns Used

### 1. AAA Pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
All tests follow the standard AAA pattern for clarity and consistency.

### 2. Mock Dependencies
- Uses Moq framework for mocking dependencies
- Properly isolates units under test
- Comprehensive setup for various scenarios

### 3. Edge Case Coverage
- Null parameter handling
- Empty collection scenarios
- Non-existent entity operations
- Exception propagation testing

### 4. Comprehensive Assertions
- Return type verification
- Value equality checks
- Collection content validation
- Exception type verification

## Technologies and Frameworks

- **xUnit** - Testing framework
- **Moq** - Mocking framework
- **MockQueryable.Moq** - For mocking EF Core queryables
- **ASP.NET Core Identity** - For user/role management mocking
- **System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations** - For DTO validation testing

## Key Features Tested

### Authentication Flow
- Internal authentication with username/email and password
- External authentication integration
- JWT token generation and validation
- Session management and security

### Authorization System
- Role-based access control
- Permission inheritance through role hierarchy
- Page-level access control
- Resource-specific permissions

### User Management
- User CRUD operations
- Password management
- User-role associations
- External vs internal user handling

### Role Management
- Role CRUD operations
- Permission assignment to roles
- Role hierarchy management
- Dynamic role creation

## Running the Tests

To run all unit tests:
```bash
cd AdminPanel.Tests
dotnet test
```

To run specific test classes:
```bash
dotnet test --filter "ClassName=UserControllerTests"
dotnet test --filter "ClassName=RoleControllerTests"
dotnet test --filter "ClassName=AuthServiceTests"
dotnet test --filter "ClassName=DtoValidationTests"
```

## Test Coverage Goals

The unit tests aim to achieve:
- **>95% code coverage** for controllers
- **>90% code coverage** for services
- **100% coverage** of public API endpoints
- **Comprehensive error scenario coverage**

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Test Isolation** - Each test is independent and can run in any order
2. **Clear Test Names** - Descriptive names following Given_When_Then pattern
3. **Proper Mocking** - All external dependencies are mocked
4. **Exception Testing** - Both success and failure paths are tested
5. **Data Validation** - Input validation and boundary conditions are covered
6. **Performance Considerations** - Tests run efficiently with minimal setup

## Integration with CI/CD

These unit tests are designed to be integrated into continuous integration pipelines:
- Fast execution time
- No external dependencies
- Clear pass/fail indicators
- Detailed error reporting

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for expansion:
- Integration tests for full authentication flows
- Performance tests for high-load scenarios
- Security tests for authentication vulnerabilities
- Contract tests for API compatibility
